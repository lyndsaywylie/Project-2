She had to join to Google Trends file Ben pulled.

The date range was 2017-10-06 to 2018-01-09.

The premise was "does exercise/working-out improve a personâ€™s activeness?".
The data was based on:

Date
Step Count
Calories Burned
Mood
Hours of Sleep
Feeling or Activeness or Inactiveness
Weight

Weight in KG column was deleted as the focus was more on activity and more factors such as diet play a part in weight.

One could determine does working-out/exercise promotes an increase in the daily step-count or not.

There were no duplicates and a check for nulls came back none.

Using pandas, a connection was made to pgAdmin to load to the table fittrends.
The same process was followed to take the google trends data and a table was built on pgAdmin and loaded and called members.

The 2 tables, fittrends and members, can be joined on date.
