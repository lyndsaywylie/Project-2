Database Project2_Fitness

Create Table fittrends(
   id              DATE  Primary Key,
   stepcount       CHAR(4),
   mood            INT,
   calories        INT,
   active          INT,
   weight_kg       INT 
 );

96 rows


I then had to copy Ben's File and first created it in PgAdmin
create table members (
	id               DATE  primary key,
	membership_count int
);

then I joined the 2 files and his dates were not in the same range as mine so he did a new file with my data range from google treands.

SELECT fittrends.id, fittrends.stepcount, fittrends.mood, fittrends.calories, fittrends.active, fittrends.weight_kg, members.id, members.membership_count
FROM fittrends  
JOIN members  
ON fittrends.id = members.id;

result was 96 rows pulled!
